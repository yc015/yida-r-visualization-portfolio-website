I am Yida, a senior undergraduate computer science student at\r\nBucknell University.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis website hosts a portfolio of my visualizations created for the\r\nProf. Abby\r\nFlynt’s data visualization course.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visualization, my past projects focus on automating\r\nthe video-based semantic segmentation of sparsely annotated\r\nechocardiogram using deep learning. I have published two papers on this\r\ntopic at the SPIE Medical Imaging 2021 and 2022 Conference both with\r\noral presentations. My work is advised by\r\n\r\nProf. Joshua Stough  (Bucknell University) and\r\n\r\nProf. Christopher Haggerty  (Geisinger).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy presentation at SPIE Medical Imaging 2022 Conference, San Diego, CA.\r\nRecorded\r\nPresentation and\r\nSlide\r\nDeck.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also the project maintainer for KALMUS, a color analysis toolkit\r\nfor film studies. You can find the project’s GitHub Repo here,\r\n\r\nKALMUS-Color-Toolkit. The project is supported by the Mellon\r\nAcademic Year Research Fellowship awarde by Bucknell Humanities center.\r\n\r\n\r\n Screenshot of the\r\nKALMUS’\r\ngraphic user interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "author": [],
      "contents": "\r\nContent\r\nThis gallery includes:\r\n1. Generative Art\r\n2. COVID-19 Heatmap\r\n3. Coursework\r\nVisualizations\r\n4. Shiny Web Application\r\n1. Generative Art\r\nThese are the generative arts that I created with aRtsy. Different from the\r\ntraditional artworks that feeds on human’s creativity and skills, the\r\ngenerative arts use algorithms as the brush creating artwork that\r\ncaptures the inherent beauty of math and logic.\r\nFunction: Shells\r\n The position of every point\r\nwas calculated using the function\r\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\n  &x =1.5x_i + cos(x_i) \\\\     \r\n  &y =\\sqrt{|y_i|} + sin(y_i^2 + x_i^2)\r\n\\end{align}\\]\r\nwhere (x, y) is the position of generated points. The color of the\r\nfunction are 9 randomly selected complement colors.\r\n\r\nCollatz Conjecture: Flame\r\n This is the collatz\r\nconjecture created with Bucknell’s school color: Blue and Orange.\r\n\r\nLangton’s Ant: Error N Terror\r\n This is a two dimensional\r\ngrid colored by the Langton’s\r\nant, a turing machine that follows a specific set of rules.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n2. COVID-19 Heatmap\r\nThis section includes the COVID-19 heatmap for worldwide confirmed\r\ncases, deaths, and recoveries. The data comes from the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity’s Coronavirus\r\ndataset. I created the animation using the gganimate package.\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Cases From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n\r\nThis heatmap shows the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from the\r\nJan. 22, 2020 to Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes the changes in\r\ncumulative confirmed cases of 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of cumulative cases. As the animation shows, the\r\ncases quickly developed in Jan 2020 and spread to the majoritiy of world\r\naround the June 2020. By Oct. 13, 2021, the U.S., Brazil, and India bear\r\nthe largest cumulative confirmed cases.\r\nI created the heatmap by first subseting the confirmed\r\ncases from the original dataset. I summed the\r\ncases variable on the level of date\r\nand country (which are also the variables of JHU’s\r\nCOVID dataset). To get the cumulative cases, I then cumsum\r\nthe grouped cases on date, which is also the state of\r\nanimation.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 Daily\r\nCases From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n This\r\nheatmap shows the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Jan. 22, 2020\r\nto Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of daily confirmed cases. Most of the countries\r\nhas reported their first COVID-19 cases since the April 2020. China had\r\nthe largest number of daily confirmed cases at the beginning of the\r\npandemic (from Jan 2020 to May 2020), and daily cases in the U.S.,\r\nIndia, Brazil surged since April 2020.\r\nI created the heatmap by first subseting the confirmed\r\ncases from the original dataset. I then summed the\r\ncases variable on the level of date\r\nand country to get the number of daily cases. The\r\nanimation transits along the date variable.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Deaths From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n\r\nThis heatmap shows the cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 infection\r\nfrom the Jan. 22, 2020 to Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions\r\nand countries. I fill the heatmap with the number of cumulative deaths.\r\nThe death cases surged in China from Jan. 2020 to May 2020. By the\r\nOctober of 2021, most of the COVID-19 deaths occurred in the U.S.,\r\nRussia, India, and Brazil.\r\nThe heatmap is created with a subset of death cases\r\nfrom the original dataset, following the same procedures for creating\r\nthe cumulative confirmed cases heatmap.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Recoveries From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n This\r\nheatmap shows the cumulative COVID-19 recoveries from the Jan. 22, 2020\r\nto Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of cumulative recoveries. By Oct. 13, 2021, most\r\nof the recoveries occurred in the U.S., Russia, India, Brazil, and\r\nCanada.\r\nThe heatmap is created with a subset of recovery\r\ncases from the original dataset, following the same procedures\r\nfor creating the cumulative confirmed cases heatmap.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n3. Coursework Visualizations\r\nChallenge of First-Gen\r\nCollege Students\r\n This\r\nscatter plot shows the relationship between the completion rate and\r\npercent of the first-generation student among the U.S. institutions. The\r\nvariable on the x-axis is the percent of students who finish their\r\nprogram within 150% of normal time (completion rate). The variable on\r\nthe y-axis is the percent of first generation student at a\r\ninstitution.\r\nThe scatter plot and the trend line show the negative correlation\r\nbetween the number of first-generation student and the institution’s\r\naverage completion rate, revealing the hardship of first-gen students at\r\nthe U.S. colleges.\r\nThe data used to create this plot come from the CollegeScores\r\ndataset of the Lock5Data\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nMore Exercise Better\r\nmetabolism!\r\n\r\nThis violin plots overlay with box plots that show the distribution\r\nof student’s pulse rate based on their reported exercise frequency. The\r\nvariable on the x-axis of the plot is how frequent a surveyed student\r\nwill exercise (none, sometimes, or frequently). The variable on the\r\ny-axis of the plot is the pulse rate of the surveyed students.\r\nThe plot shows that most students who frequently participate in\r\nphysical activities will have a lower pulse rate. This finding is\r\nexpected from a clinical perspective since physical exercise will\r\nimprove a person’s metabolism, allowing more blood pumped into the\r\ncirculation within each beat. Thus, the heart won’t need to pump that\r\nfrequently (lower pulse rate) to sustain the system.\r\nThe data used to create this plot come from a subset of the Student\r\nSurvey Data dataset from Lock5Data\r\npackage. Only the complete observations are used in creating the plot\r\nabove.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n4. Shiny Web App\r\nI also created an interactive Shiny web app that aims to help\r\nthe intro-level stats students to understand the confidence\r\nlevel. Below are a screenshot of the application and a static plot\r\nthat can be created with this app.\r\n\r\nHere\r\nis the Link to our Shiny App\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the Shiny App user interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample plot that can be created with this application.\r\n\r\nBack to the\r\ntop \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
