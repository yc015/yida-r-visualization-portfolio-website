I am Yida, a senior undergraduate computer science student at\r\nBucknell University.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis website hosts a portfolio of my visualizations created for the Prof. Abby\r\nFlynt’s data visualization course.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visualization, my past projects focus on automating\r\nthe video-based semantic segmentation of sparsely annotated\r\nechocardiogram using deep learning. I have published two papers on this\r\ntopic at the SPIE Medical Imaging 2021 and 2022 Conference both with\r\noral presentations. My work is advised by\r\n\r\nProf. Joshua Stough  (Bucknell University) and\r\n\r\nProf. Christopher Haggerty  (Geisinger).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy presentation at SPIE Medical Imaging 2022 Conference, San Diego, CA.\r\nRecorded\r\nPresentation and Slide\r\nDeck.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also the project maintainer for KALMUS, a color analysis toolkit\r\nfor film studies. You can find the project’s GitHub Repo here,\r\n\r\nKALMUS-Color-Toolkit. The project is supported by the Mellon\r\nAcademic Year Research Fellowship awarde by Bucknell Humanities center.\r\n\r\n\r\n Screenshot of the KALMUS’\r\ngraphic user interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
