      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Indicators of Heart\r\nDiseases\r\nHeart disease is one of the most prevalent and fatal disease in the\r\nUnited States. According CDC, there are 18.2 millions cardiovascular\r\npatients in the United States, and 659,000 people die from the heart\r\ndisease each year.\r\nIdentifying the risk factor of developing heart disease allows\r\nclinicians to provide preventive treatment for potential patients.\r\nHowever, heart disease are correlated with a lot of factors, such as\r\nage, smoking, and engagement with physical activities. None of these\r\nfactors alone seem to be determining and provide a good prediction of\r\nfuture heart failures.\r\nThus, in this exploratory data analysis, we will leverages\r\nvisualization techniques to discover the relationship between heart\r\ndisease and different risk factors, digging out the strongest indicators\r\nof cardiac diseases.\r\nContent\r\nThis project includes:\r\n1. Dataset Description\r\n2. Risk Factor: Age\r\n3. Risk Factor: Smoking\r\n4. Correlation between Sleep and Heart\r\nDisease\r\n5. Complications of Heart Disease\r\n6. Risk Factors: Diabetes &\r\nObesity\r\n7. Overview of All Risk Factors\r\n1. Dataset Description\r\nThe dataset used in the project comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor\r\nSurveillance System of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\r\nCDC collected these data from the United State’s residents through\r\nannual telephone survey. The dataset used in the project is the CDC’s\r\n2020 survey of 319,795 adults with answers to 18 selected survey\r\nquestions.\r\nIn this project, we will explore the relationships among heart\r\ndisease, smoking, phyiscal activity engagement, body mass index (BMI),\r\naverage sleep time, stroke, and diabetes. Here are some short\r\ndescriptions of these chosen variables:\r\nHeart Disease: A Binary variable that is\r\nYes if the survey’s respondent have ever reported\r\nhaving coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction and\r\nNo otherwise.\r\nSmoking: A Binary variable that is\r\nYes if the respondent has smoked at least 100\r\ncigarettes in their entire life and No otherwise.\r\nPhysical Activity Engagement: A Binary\r\nvariable that is Yes if the respondent did physical\r\nactivity or exercise during the past 30 days other than their regular\r\njob and No otherwise.\r\nBody Mass Index (BMI): A Continuous\r\nvariable which can be computed as the body mass (in kilograms) divided\r\nby the square of the body height (in meters). The unit of BMI is\r\nkilograms / \\(\\text{meters}^2\\),\r\nAverage Sleep Time: An Integer variable\r\nthat represents the average hours of sleep of the respondent in\r\n24-hour.\r\nStroke: A Binary variable that is\r\nYes if the respondent have ever reported having a\r\nstroke and No otherwise.\r\nDiabetes: A Categorical variable that\r\nrepresents if the respondent has ever had the diabetes in their life.\r\nThe variable has four categories: “No” (Never have diabetes), “No,\r\nborderline” (Do not have diabetes but have risk of developing it), “Yes”\r\n(Have or ever had diabetes), and “Yes, during pregnancy” (have/had\r\ndiabetes during the pregnancy).\r\nGeneral Health Condition: A Categorical\r\nvariable. It is what the respondent would say about their health\r\ncondition in general. The variable has five categories: “Excellent”,\r\n“Very Good”, “Good”, “Fair”, and “Poor”.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Heart Disease and Age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAge is a common risk factor for cardiac and vascular diseases. As we\r\nbecome older, our metabolism and circulation system also degenerates.\r\nThe elder citizens are thus more likely to develop coronary heart\r\ndisease or myocardial infarction than their younger counterparts. As\r\nshown in the bar chart above, the portion of respondents who have or\r\never had the heart disease increases along the ages. For the respondents\r\nwho are 80 or older, more than 20% of them reported having heart\r\ndiseases.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n3. Heart Disease and Smoking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the age, another common risk factor for the cancer,\r\ncardiac, and pulmonary diseases is smoking. In the survey, CDC asks if a\r\nrespondent have ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their entire\r\nlife. If the answer is yes, CDC records the variable Smoking as\r\nYes for that (respondent) observation.\r\nAs shown in the mosaic plot, the portion of respondents with heart\r\ndisease is almost double when the respondents smoke, indicating the\r\nsmoking is a major risk factor. The respondents who smoked and have\r\nheart disease are also more likely to have a poor or fair general health\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1\r\nAlluvial Plot: relationships among heart disease, age, and smoking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the previous two sections, we have seen that the\r\nAge and Smoking are two strong\r\nindicators of heart disease. This Alluvial plot flowing from three age\r\ngroups and smoking history to the heart disease conditions will help us\r\nconfirm these findings.\r\nTo create this Alluvial plot, I group the respondents with age from\r\n18 - 44, 45 - 64, and 65 or older into three groups, each have roughly a\r\nequal number of respondents. Most of the red flow (respondents who have\r\nor ever had heart disease) comes from the age group: > 65\r\nand then flow to the smoking: Yes category. This is consistent\r\nwith our previous observations.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n4. Heart Disease and Sleep Time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many hours of sleep does a respondent have when they have or\r\nnever had heart disease? From the barchart above, we can find that\r\npeople who sleep 3 hours (too short), 12 hours, and > 19 hours (too\r\nlong) are most likely to have heart disease. Most of the healthy\r\nrespondents sleep around 7 hours per day.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n5. Common Complication of Heart Disease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the common complications of the heart disease? We know that\r\na vascular disease, such as stroke, usually comes with\r\na deteriorated circulation system. As shown in the Venn Diagram, about\r\n37.1% of respondents who have stroke also reported having heart disease.\r\nSurprisingly, diabetes also seem to be correlated with heart disease.\r\n33.3% of respondents who have ever reported having heart disease also\r\nhave diabetes.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n6. Heart Disease, Diabetes, and\r\nObesity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not obvious why the diabetes is correlated to the heart\r\nfailure. However, we know that the type 2 diabetes usually relate to the\r\nobesity (high BMI), which maybe the actual cause of heart disease.\r\nFrom the box plot above, we can see that the respondents with\r\ndiabetes (except during pregnancy) have a higher median BMI, and the\r\nheart disease further magnifies this difference. For people with no or\r\nborderline diabetes, their median BMI is higher when they have ever had\r\nthe heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the animation plot above. For almost all racial groups, except\r\nthe native American, people who ever have heart disease also have a\r\nhigher BMI (obesity).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increasing fat in human body can enlarge the ventricle and atrium\r\nchambers, severely damaging the cardiac functions. Thus, a positive\r\ncorrelation between BMI and heart disease is expected. In the mosaic\r\nplot above, we introduce an additional variable, Physical Activity\r\nEngagment, and we discretize the BMI into four levels: underweight\r\n(BMI < 18), healthy (18 <= BMI < 25), overweight (25 <= BMI\r\n< 30), and obesity (30 <= BMI).\r\nAs the plot shows, not only does the people with heart disease have a\r\nhigher obesity rate but they also engage less with the physical\r\nactivity.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n7. An Overview of Heart Disease Risk Factors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize our findings, I compute the Chi-square correlations\r\nbetween the risk factors that we identify in the previous sections. The\r\nChi-square correlation ranges from -1 to 1, the most negative to the\r\nmost positive correlation.\r\nAs the correlation matrix shows, the vascular disease, stroke, has\r\nthe strongest correlation with heart disease, and the engagement with\r\nphysical activity has the most negative correlation with developing\r\nheart disease. The obesity has a strong relationship with diabetes but\r\nis not an indicator of heart disease.\r\nIn short, exercising, no smoking, and having less sugar and fat in\r\nour meals seem to be the best way protect us from developing heart\r\ndisease.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Generative Art\r\nThese are the generative arts that I created with aRtsy. Different from the\r\ntraditional artworks that feeds on human’s creativity and skills, the\r\ngenerative arts use algorithms as the brush creating artwork that\r\ncaptures the inherent beauty of math and logic.\r\nFunction: Shells\r\n The position of every point\r\nwas calculated using the function\r\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\n  &x =1.5x_i + cos(x_i) \\\\     \r\n  &y =\\sqrt{|y_i|} + sin(y_i^2 + x_i^2)\r\n\\end{align}\\]\r\nwhere (x, y) is the position of generated points. The color of the\r\nfunction are 9 randomly selected complement colors.\r\n\r\nCollatz Conjecture: Flame\r\n This is the collatz\r\nconjecture created with Bucknell’s school color: Blue and Orange.\r\n\r\nLangton’s Ant: Error N Terror\r\n This is a two dimensional\r\ngrid colored by the Langton’s\r\nant, a turing machine that follows a specific set of rules.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n2. COVID-19 Heatmap\r\nThis section includes the COVID-19 heatmap for worldwide confirmed\r\ncases, deaths, and recoveries. The data comes from the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity’s Coronavirus\r\ndataset. I created the animation using the gganimate package.\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Cases From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n\r\nThis heatmap shows the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from the\r\nJan. 22, 2020 to Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes the changes in\r\ncumulative confirmed cases of 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of cumulative cases. As the animation shows, the\r\ncases quickly developed in Jan 2020 and spread to the majoritiy of world\r\naround the June 2020. By Oct. 13, 2021, the U.S., Brazil, and India bear\r\nthe largest cumulative confirmed cases.\r\nI created the heatmap by first subseting the confirmed\r\ncases from the original dataset. I summed the\r\ncases variable on the level of date\r\nand country (which are also the variables of JHU’s\r\nCOVID dataset). To get the cumulative cases, I then cumsum\r\nthe grouped cases on date, which is also the state of\r\nanimation.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 Daily\r\nCases From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n This\r\nheatmap shows the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Jan. 22, 2020\r\nto Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of daily confirmed cases. Most of the countries\r\nhas reported their first COVID-19 cases since the April 2020. China had\r\nthe largest number of daily confirmed cases at the beginning of the\r\npandemic (from Jan 2020 to May 2020), and daily cases in the U.S.,\r\nIndia, Brazil surged since April 2020.\r\nI created the heatmap by first subseting the confirmed\r\ncases from the original dataset. I then summed the\r\ncases variable on the level of date\r\nand country to get the number of daily cases. The\r\nanimation transits along the date variable.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Deaths From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n\r\nThis heatmap shows the cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 infection\r\nfrom the Jan. 22, 2020 to Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions\r\nand countries. I fill the heatmap with the number of cumulative deaths.\r\nThe death cases surged in China from Jan. 2020 to May 2020. By the\r\nOctober of 2021, most of the COVID-19 deaths occurred in the U.S.,\r\nRussia, India, and Brazil.\r\nThe heatmap is created with a subset of death cases\r\nfrom the original dataset, following the same procedures for creating\r\nthe cumulative confirmed cases heatmap.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19\r\nCumulative Recoveries From Jan. 2020 to Oct. 2021\r\n This\r\nheatmap shows the cumulative COVID-19 recoveries from the Jan. 22, 2020\r\nto Oct. 13, 2021. The map includes 195 regions and countries. I fill the\r\nheatmap with the number of cumulative recoveries. By Oct. 13, 2021, most\r\nof the recoveries occurred in the U.S., Russia, India, Brazil, and\r\nCanada.\r\nThe heatmap is created with a subset of recovery\r\ncases from the original dataset, following the same procedures\r\nfor creating the cumulative confirmed cases heatmap.\r\nNotice that some countries, such as Turkmenistan and North Korea, are\r\nnot included in this dataset. The unreported countries are colored in\r\ngrey on this map.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n3. Coursework Visualizations\r\nChallenge of First-Gen\r\nCollege Students\r\n This\r\nscatter plot shows the relationship between the completion rate and\r\npercent of the first-generation student among the U.S. institutions. The\r\nvariable on the x-axis is the percent of students who finish their\r\nprogram within 150% of normal time (completion rate). The variable on\r\nthe y-axis is the percent of first generation student at a\r\ninstitution.\r\nThe scatter plot and the trend line show the negative correlation\r\nbetween the number of first-generation student and the institution’s\r\naverage completion rate, revealing the hardship of first-gen students at\r\nthe U.S. colleges.\r\nThe data used to create this plot come from the CollegeScores\r\ndataset of the Lock5Data\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nMore Exercise Better\r\nmetabolism!\r\n\r\nThis violin plots overlay with box plots that show the distribution\r\nof student’s pulse rate based on their reported exercise frequency. The\r\nvariable on the x-axis of the plot is how frequent a surveyed student\r\nwill exercise (none, sometimes, or frequently). The variable on the\r\ny-axis of the plot is the pulse rate of the surveyed students.\r\nThe plot shows that most students who frequently participate in\r\nphysical activities will have a lower pulse rate. This finding is\r\nexpected from a clinical perspective since physical exercise will\r\nimprove a person’s metabolism, allowing more blood pumped into the\r\ncirculation within each beat. Thus, the heart won’t need to pump that\r\nfrequently (lower pulse rate) to sustain the system.\r\nThe data used to create this plot come from a subset of the Student\r\nSurvey Data dataset from Lock5Data\r\npackage. Only the complete observations are used in creating the plot\r\nabove.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n4. Shiny Web App\r\nI also created an interactive Shiny web app that aims to help\r\nthe intro-level stats students to understand the confidence\r\nlevel. Below are a screenshot of the application and a static plot\r\nthat can be created with this app.\r\n\r\nHere\r\nis the Link to our Shiny App\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot of the Shiny App user interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample plot that can be created with this application.\r\n\r\nBack to the\r\ntop \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
