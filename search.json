I am Yida, a senior undergraduate computer science student at\r\nBucknell University.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis website hosts a portfolio of my visualizations created for the\r\nProf. Abby\r\nFlynt’s data visualization course.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visualization, my past projects focus on automating\r\nthe video-based semantic segmentation of sparsely annotated\r\nechocardiogram using deep learning. I have published two papers on this\r\ntopic at the SPIE Medical Imaging 2021 and 2022 Conference both with\r\noral presentations. My work is advised by\r\n\r\nProf. Joshua Stough  (Bucknell University) and\r\n\r\nProf. Christopher Haggerty  (Geisinger).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy presentation at SPIE Medical Imaging 2022 Conference, San Diego, CA.\r\nRecorded\r\nPresentation and\r\nSlide\r\nDeck.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also the project maintainer for KALMUS, a color analysis toolkit\r\nfor film studies. You can find the project’s GitHub Repo here,\r\n\r\nKALMUS-Color-Toolkit. The project is supported by the Mellon\r\nAcademic Year Research Fellowship awarde by Bucknell Humanities center.\r\n\r\n\r\n Screenshot of the\r\nKALMUS’\r\ngraphic user interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Generative Art\r\nThese are the generative arts that I created with aRtsy. Different from the\r\ntraditional artworks that feeds on human’s creativity and skills, the\r\ngenerative arts use algorithms as the brush creating artwork that\r\ncaptures the inherent beauty of math and logic.\r\nFunction: Shells\r\n The position of every point\r\nwas calculated using the function\r\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\n  &x =1.5x_i + cos(x_i) \\\\     \r\n  &y =\\sqrt{|y_i|} + sin(y_i^2 + x_i^2)\r\n\\end{align}\\]\r\nwhere (x, y) is the position of generated points. The color of the\r\nfunction are 9 randomly selected complement colors.\r\n\r\nCollatz Conjecture: Flame\r\n This is the collatz\r\nconjecture created with Bucknell’s school color: Blue and Orange.\r\n\r\nLangton’s Ant: Error N Terror\r\n This is a two dimensional\r\ngrid colored by the Langton’s\r\nant, a turing machine that follows a specific set of rules.\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n2. COVID-19 Heatmap\r\nThis section includes the COVID-19 heatmap for worldwide confirmed\r\ncases, deaths, and recoveries. The data comes from the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity’s Coronavirus\r\ndataset. I created the animation using the gganimate package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to the\r\ntop\r\n\r\n3. Coursework Visualizations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
